<strong>Hi there 👋</strong>
  
<br />👨‍💻 - I am programmer and computer technician.

📒 - I studied DAM(Cross-platform application development) and SMR (Microcomputer systems and local networks).

💭 - One of my dreams is to work as a teacher 👨‍🏫, to live on the field 🏞️, and create one camper 🚗  to travel 🗺️ and work 💻 at the same time ⌛

🎯 - In my free time I play 🏊‍♂️🚴🏃 and more activities...
